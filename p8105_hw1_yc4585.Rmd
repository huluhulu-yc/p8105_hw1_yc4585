```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load dataset
```{r load data}
  data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
  str(penguins)
  nrow(penguins)
  ncol(penguins)
  number_mean = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
  number_mean
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
