```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load dataset
```{r load data, results='hide'}
  data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
  str(penguins)
  nrow(penguins)
  ncol(penguins)
  number_mean = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
  
```
        
  The the main variables in the dataset include species,island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex and year.


  The dataset have `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns, the mean of flipper length is `r number_mean`.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
