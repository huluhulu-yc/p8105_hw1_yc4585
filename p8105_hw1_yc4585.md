## Problem 1

### Load dataset

``` r
  data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
  str(penguins)
  nrow(penguins)
  ncol(penguins)
  number_mean = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The the main variables in the dataset include species,island,
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex and
year.

The dataset have 344 rows and 8 columns, the mean of flipper length is
200.9152047.

### Draw sactterplot

``` r
library(ggplot2)
plot_data = data.frame(
  x = penguins$bill_length_mm,
  y = penguins$flipper_length_mm
)

ggplot(plot_data, aes(x=x, y=y, colour = penguins$species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Flipper Length (mm)")
```

``` r
ggsave(
  filename = "penguins.png", 
  width = 7,                     
  height = 7,                    
  units = "in",                   
  dpi = 600                      
)
```

## Problem 2

``` r
  library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10,0,1)
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0
  vec_character = c("my","name","is","yuhao","chang","I","like","playing","the","guitar")
  pre_factor = c("A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "C", "C")
  vec_factor = factor(pre_factor, levels = c("A", "B", "C"))
  my_data = data.frame(
    vec_numeric ,
    vec_logical ,
    vec_character ,
    vec_factor )
  print(my_data)
```

    ##    vec_numeric vec_logical vec_character vec_factor
    ## 1   -0.6910598       FALSE            my          A
    ## 2    0.2551750        TRUE          name          A
    ## 3   -1.1517871       FALSE            is          A
    ## 4    1.2789311        TRUE         yuhao          A
    ## 5    1.1730594        TRUE         chang          A
    ## 6   -1.3397878       FALSE             I          A
    ## 7   -1.9643307       FALSE          like          B
    ## 8    2.5245791        TRUE       playing          B
    ## 9   -0.7984912       FALSE           the          C
    ## 10   0.1663682        TRUE        guitar          C

The code above show the required data frame.

``` r
Vec_Numeric = my_data %>% pull(vec_numeric)
mean(Vec_Numeric)
```

    ## [1] -0.05473438

``` r
Vec_Logical = my_data %>% pull(vec_logical)
mean(Vec_Logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
Vec_Character = my_data %>% pull(vec_character)
mean(Vec_Character)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(Vec_Character): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
Vec_Factor = my_data %>% pull(vec_factor)
mean(Vec_Factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(Vec_Factor): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We can calculate the mean of numeric vector and logical vector, when
calculating the mean of logical vectors, TRUE is treated as 1 and FALSE
is treated as 0. But we cannot calculate the mean of character vector
and factor vector.

``` r
num_logical = as.numeric(Vec_Logical)
num_character = as.numeric(Vec_Character)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
num_factor = as.numeric(Vec_Factor)
```

For logical variables, TRUE is converted to 1 and FALSE is converted to
0. For character variables,this conversion results in NA values,
suggesting character strings cannot be directly converted to numbers.
For factor variables, the results can be converted to numbers and
different levels of factors have different numbers.

When we calculate the mean of variables, R can compute the mean for
numeric and logical types directly. However, character and factor types
require conversion. Even after conversion, we cannot calculate the mean
of character types, as this results in NAs.
